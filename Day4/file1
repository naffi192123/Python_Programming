4. Write a NumPy program to test if any of the elements of a given array is non-zero.
5. Write a NumPy program to test a given array element-wise for finiteness (not infinity or not a Number).
6. Write a NumPy program to convert a list of numeric value into a one-dimensional NumPy array.
7. Write a NumPy program to create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 2 to 10.
8. Write a NumPy program to create a null vector of size 10 and update sixth value to 11.
9. Write a NumPy program to create a array with values ranging from 12 to 38.
10. Write a NumPy program to reverse an array (first element becomes last).
